Introduction
------------
The RTRlib implements the client-side part of the RPKI-RTR library.

It was succesfull tested under Linux and FreeBSD.
This release contains a beta version of the RTR library and a rtrclient
program.
The binary can be found in the tools/ directory. The program connect to an
RTR-Server over TCP or SSH and prints the validation state of BGP-Prefixes,
which were received from the RTR-Server, on STDOUT.



Requirements
------------
To build the RTRlib the CMake build system must be installed. If you
want to establish a connection to an RTR-Server over ssh, the libssh
0.4.x library must also be installed. Doxygen (optional) is required to
create the HTML documentation.

Compilation
-----------

* Generate Makefile:

  Without debugging options

    cmake -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release .

  With debug symbols and debug messages:

    cmake -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug .

  If the libssh isn't installed within the systems include and library
  directories you can run cmake with the following parameters:

      -D LIBSSH_LIBRARY=<path-to-libssh.so>
      -D LIBSSH_INCLUDE=<include-directory>

  To specify another directory where the RTRlib will be installed, you
  can pass the following argument to cmake:

      -D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<path>

* Build library, tests, and tools

    make


Installation
------------
To copy libraries and headers to system directories run (optional):

    make install


Linking to RTRlib
----------------------
The name of the shared library is rtr. To link programs to the RTRlib
pass gcc the parameter: -lrtr


API Documentation
-----------------
The RTRlib includes a HTML documentation of the API. To build them,
doxygen must be installed. The documentation will be located in the
docs/ directory after you run:

    make doc


Directories
-----------
* doxygen          - example code and graphics used in the Doxygen documentation
* rtrlib           - include and source code files of the RTRlib
* tests            - unit tests
* tools            - contains the rtrclients
