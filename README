Introduction
------------
The RTRlib implements the client-side part of the RPKI-RTR protocol.
This release supports the IETF drafts draft-ietf-sidr-rpki-rtr-19 and
draft-ietf-sidr-pfx-validate-03. It was successfully tested on Linux
and FreeBSD.

This package contains also the rtrclient program. It connects to an
RTR-Server over TCP or SSH and shows on STDOUT the validation state of
the BGP prefixes, which has been received from the RTR server. The
binary can be found in the tools/ directory.


Release History:
----------------
* Version 0.2
    - RTR manager component implemented
    - extended debug message
    - renamed rtr_update_fp callback to pfx_update_fp. Callback is
      executed for every added and deleted pfx_records
    - ip addresses are stored in host byte order
    - rtr_sockets reconnect automatically on errors
    - many bug fixes
* Version 0.1
    Beta version


Requirements
------------
To build the RTRlib the CMake build system must be installed. If you
want to establish a connection to an RTR-Server over ssh, the libssh
0.4.x library must also be installed. Doxygen (optional) is required to
create the HTML documentation.

Compilation
-----------

* Generate Makefile:

  Without debugging options

    cmake -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release .

  With debug symbols and debug messages:

    cmake -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug .

  If the libssh isn't installed within the systems include and library
  directories you can run cmake with the following parameters:

      -D LIBSSH_LIBRARY=<path-to-libssh.so>
      -D LIBSSH_INCLUDE=<include-directory>

  To specify another directory where the RTRlib will be installed, you
  can pass the following argument to cmake:

      -D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<path>

* Build library, tests, and tools

    make


Installation
------------
To copy libraries and headers to system directories run (optional):

    make install


Linking to RTRlib
----------------------
The name of the shared library is rtr. To link programs to the RTRlib
pass gcc the parameter:

    -lrtr


API Documentation
-----------------
The RTRlib includes a HTML documentation of the API. To build them,
doxygen must be installed. The documentation will be located in the
docs/ directory after you run:

    make doc


Directories
-----------
* cmake/      - CMake modules
* doxygen/    - Example code and graphics used in the Doxygen
                documentation
* rtrlib/     - Header and source code files of the RTRlib
* tests/      - Unit tests
* tools/      - Contains the rtrclient
