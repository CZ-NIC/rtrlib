Introduction
------------
The RTRlib implements the client-side part of the RPKI-RTR protocol and
BGP Prefix Origin Validation. This release supports the IETF drafts
draft-ietf-sidr-rpki-rtr-26 and draft-ietf-sidr-pfx-validate-03. It was
successfully tested on Linux and FreeBSD.

This package contains also the rtrclient program. It connects to an
RTR-Server over TCP or SSH and shows on STDOUT the validation state of
the BGP prefixes that has been received from the RTR server. The program
can be found in the tools/ directory.

Detailed documentation is available in docs/.


Release History:
----------------
* Version 0.2
    - Support of RTR-Server failover mechanisms (RTR manager component
      implemented)
    - Automatic reconnect of rtr_socket in case of errors
    - Renamed rtr_update_fp callback to pfx_update_fp. Callback will be
      executed only if a pfx_record has been added or deleted.
    - Representation of IP addresses in host byte order within pfx_table
    - New convenience function to transform an IP address string into a
      struct ip_addr and vice versa
    - support for the IETF drafts draft-ietf-sidr-rpki-rtr-19 and
      draft-ietf-sidr-pfx-validate-03
    - Extended debug messages
    - Many bug fixes
* Version 0.1
    - Beta version


Requirements
------------
To build the RTRlib, the CMake build system must be installed.

To establish a SSH connection between RTR-Client and RTR-Server, the
libssh 0.4.x library must also be installed.

Doxygen (optional) is required to create the HTML documentation.


Compilation
-----------

* Generate Makefile:

  Without debugging options

    cmake -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release .

  With debug symbols and debug messages:

    cmake -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug .

  If the libssh isn't installed within the systems include and library
  directories you can run cmake with the following parameters:

      -D LIBSSH_LIBRARY=<path-to-libssh.so>
      -D LIBSSH_INCLUDE=<include-directory>

  To specify another directory where the RTRlib will be installed, you
  can pass the following argument to cmake:

      -D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<path>

* Build library, tests, and tools

    make


Installation
------------
To copy libraries and headers to system directories, run (optional):

    make install


Linking to RTRlib
----------------------
The name of the shared library is rtr. To link programs to the RTRlib,
pass the following parameter to gcc:

    -lrtr


API Documentation
-----------------
The RTRlib includes a HTML documentation of the API. To build them,
doxygen must be installed. The documentation will be located in the
docs/ directory after the execution of:

    make doc


Test RTR-Server Connection
--------------------------
The following command establishes a plain TCP connection to an
RTR-Server using the rtrclient command line tool:

    tools/rtrclient tcp rpki.realmv6.org 42420

rpki.realmv6.org is an open RTR-Server instance for testing purposes,
which runs rcynic. It listens on port 42420 and validates ROAs from the
following trust anchors: AfriNIC, APNIC, ARIN, LACNIC, RIPE.

-----------
* cmake/      - CMake modules
* doxygen/    - Example code and graphics used in the Doxygen
                documentation
* rtrlib/     - Header and source code files of the RTRlib
